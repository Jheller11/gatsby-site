# Reverse a String

## Description

This project is a place for me to post information about stuff I'm coding, things I've researched, or questions I've been asked in job interviews. I try to include simple code samples where appropriate, mostly in JS unless the topic is in a specific language.

It also includes helpful tools like an embedded JS repl.

Using Gatsby/GraphQL I create a markdown for each concept/topic and categorize based on the frontmatter.
